<p><code>--- question 1 fill here ---</code></p>
<p>Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the <code>figures</code> subfolder (please only use <code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code> or <code>.jpeg</code>) and then add the following code in your answer:</p>
<p><code>![my_image](figures/&lt;image&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;)</code></p>
<p>In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the <code>report.py</code> script that provides two utility functions:</p>
<p>Running:</p>
<p><code>bash
python report.py html</code></p>
<p>Will generate a <code>.html</code> page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this <code>reports</code> folder and then use this utility to generate a <code>.html</code> page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.</p>
<p>Running</p>
<p><code>bash
python report.py check</code></p>
<p>Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with</p>
<p><code>bash
pip install typer markdown</code></p>

<h2>Group information</h2>
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the group number you signed up on <learn.inside.dtu.dk></strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Group 25</p>
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the study number for each member in the group</strong></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><em>sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>s252605, s171204, </p>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you end up using any open-source frameworks/packages not covered in the course during your project? If so</strong>
<strong>which did you use and how did they help you complete the project?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 0-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the</em>
<em>package to do ... and ... in our project</em>.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<p>Yes, we used a couple of open-source packages beyond the core course material:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>entsoe-py</strong>: A Python wrapper for the ENTSO-E API to automatically download hourly electricity load data for Denmark, which was critical for our data collection phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plotly</strong>: For interactive data visualization instead of just Matplotlib, helping us better present training results and model analysis.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These packages complemented the course material by enabling efficient data collection and better visualization for stakeholder communication.</p>
<h2>Coding environment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go</strong>
<strong>through to get an exact copy of your environment.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a</em>
<em>complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We managed dependencies using <code>uv</code> and maintained a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file that specifies all project dependencies with pinned versions. This approach ensures reproducibility across team members and environments.</p>
<p>For a new team member to get an exact copy of our environment, they would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository from GitHub</li>
<li>Install <code>uv</code> (if not already installed): <code>curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh</code></li>
<li>Run <code>uv sync</code> in the project root directory, which creates a virtual environment and installs all dependencies specified in <code>pyproject.toml</code> and locked in <code>uv.lock</code></li>
<li>Activate the environment: <code>source .venv/bin/activate</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>uv.lock</code> file ensures that exact versions of all dependencies (including transitive dependencies) are installed, preventing version conflicts or "works on my machine" issues. We also used Python 3.12+ as specified in <code>requires-python = "&gt;=3.12"</code> in the <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>
<p>This approach is superior to <code>requirements.txt</code> because it provides better dependency resolution and handles both main and development dependencies through dependency groups in the same file.</p>
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your</strong>
<strong>code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder</em>
<em>because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our</em>
<em>experiments.</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the cookiecutter template, we filled out the <code>src/mlops_loadconsumption/</code> folder with <code>data.py</code>, <code>model.py</code>, <code>train.py</code>, <code>visualize.py</code>, and <code>api.py</code> modules. The <code>data.py</code> module handles data fetching from the ENTSO-E API and preprocessing. The <code>model.py</code> contains our Conv1d neural network architecture, while <code>train.py</code> implements the training pipeline with validation and early stopping. We added a <code>visualize.py</code> module for interactive plotting using Plotly, and an <code>api.py</code> module that creates a FastAPI application for model inference.</p>
<p>We also filled out the <code>configs/</code> directory with configuration constants and the <code>dockerfiles/</code> folder with containerization files. Additionally, we set up GitHub Actions workflows in <code>.github/workflows/</code> for continuous integration.</p>
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,</strong>
<strong>explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These</em>
<em>concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...</em></p>

</blockquote>
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.</p>

<h3>Question 8</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close</strong>
<strong>to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
</em>code and even if we were then...*</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Question 9</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and</strong>
<strong>pull request can help improve version control.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in</em>
<em>addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>--- question 9 fill here ---</p>
<h3>Question 10</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version</strong>
<strong>control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our</em>
<em>pipeline</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We did make use of DVC in the following way: instead of just letting our Google Cloud bucket be a "folder in the sky", we used it to track the exact version of the electricity data we pulled from the ENTSO-E API. Because that API data can change or get updated by utility companies, we needed a way to lock it down to ensure our experiments remained consistent. In the end, it helped us in three ways: 1. We used <code>dvc status</code> to spot API data updates, which told us if we were training on the same data or if the provider had sent us new information. 2. It helped us control the preprocessing part of our pipeline by ensuring that our raw files and processed split data always aligned with the specific version of the code we were running. 3. It allowed us to time-travel because if a new data update ever broke our model, we could simply jump back to an older Git commit where that <code>data.dvc</code> file pointed and run <code>dvc pull</code>to get the exact data that worked before.</p>
<h3>Question 11</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,</strong>
<strong>linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free</strong>
<strong>to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing</em>
<em>and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen</em>
<em>here: <weblink></em></p>

<h2>Running code and tracking experiments</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
especially the reproducibility of your experiments.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would</strong>
<strong>run a experiment.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used Hydra to keep track of hyperparameter tuning. We stored the default settings in the <code>config.yaml</code> file which ensured every experiment was reproducible. By integrating Hydra into <code>train.py</code>, we could train with the standard defaults or perform adjustments via the command for hyper-parameter tuning. To run with default settings via <code>python src/models/train.py</code>, and to launch a custom experiment using <code>uv run train.py batch_size=256 early_stopping_patience=8</code>.</p>
<h3>Question 13</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information</strong>
<strong>is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment</em>
<em>one would have to do ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Question 14</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&amp;B (or another experiment tracking</strong>
<strong>service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take</strong>
<strong>inspiration from <a href="figures/wandb.png">this figure</a>. Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are</strong>
<strong>important.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.</em>
<em>As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 14 fill here ---</p>
<h3>Question 15</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your</strong>
<strong>experiments/project? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the</em>
<em>training docker image: <code>docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64</code>. Link to docker file: <weblink></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our project, we used Docker to create a consistent and isolated environment for model training, ensuring that all dependencies for our <code>train.py</code> script were correctly configured regardless of the host system. We organized our project by storing our configuration in a <code>dockerfiles/train.dockerfile</code>. To run the experiment, we first built the image from the <code>train.dockerfile</code> and then launched a container to execute the training. To build the image, we run: <code>docker build --platform linux/arm64 -f ./dockerfiles/train.dockerfile . -t train:latest</code>. And then we start the image and run <code>train.py</code> via <code>docker run --platform linux/arm64 train:latest</code>. This approach allowed us to package the exact versions of libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow, preventing version conflicts. Link to docker file: <a href="https://github.com/yahei-DTU/mlops_loadconsumption/blob/main/dockerfiles/train.dockerfile">https://github.com/yahei-DTU/mlops_loadconsumption/blob/main/dockerfiles/train.dockerfile</a></p>
<h3>Question 16</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you</strong>
<strong>try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling</em>
<em>run of our main code at some point that showed ...</em></p>
